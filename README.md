## JavaScript Password Generator - The Task
We were asked to modify the code on an existing page and to create a JavaScript application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## The Product
The finished product is a clean box that will display the new password, with a button below to start the password generation process.

When the Generate Password button is clicked, the user is presented with a series of pop-up boxes to determine the makeup of their secur password.  Starting with defining the number of characters:

Then asking if the password should contain Lower Case letters:

Upper Case letters:

Special Characters:

And Numbers:

Additionally, if a character length is chosen outside of the proscribed 8-128 character length, or if the character length is entered as anything but a number, such as entering "twenty" rather than "20", this error will pop up:

Finally, once all the parameters are entered, the freshly generated password displays in the Center box:
